<strong>FLORIAN</strong><br>Project made for brain day 2015 at SWPS University. The aim was to show children what the stress reaction 
is doing to our body and how our hormone system works during stress (fight or flight) and relaxation 
(as well as how the relaxation can be caused).<br>
Florian was composed of LED diodes with different colours, 5 servos, conductive sensor and reed relay. <br><br>
